            <a href="#menu4">What is React?</a>
            <p>The best fit for developing user interfaces is React, as it is a very declarative, fast, and flexible JavaScript library. It allows you to create complex user interfaces using “components,” or small, self-contained pieces of code. It controls the view layer in web applications. Despite the fact that React is more of a library than a language, it is frequently used in web development. </p>
